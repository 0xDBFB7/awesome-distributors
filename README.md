Hi! Here are a few distributors that I've come across. Many of these sell to individuals and hobbyists with residential addresses. Some may require an incorporated company.

I live in Canada; it's very likely that these suppliers won't be useful to people outside North America. Since the landscape changes fairly quickly, I'm

I am lucky to be at a respected scientific institution. If you are not able to find, recall that substitution is first in the hirarchy of controls. If you have difficulty obtaining a material or reagent, perhaps because it's expensive, difficult-to-synthesize, hazardous, offered only by a single source, et cetera, remember that others will also likely find it more difficult to apply your work in the future. Work with even mildly hazardous materials must be slower and more careful. expensive reagents limit sample size and restrict statistical power, and turn even minor slip-ups into disasters. Often a more straightforward option (a completely different assay, a ) exists, if enough time is available to search for it. 

Work in finding alternative methods, though often not visibly progressing toward the end goal, is, I believe, often justifiable.
